What's new in Wand 0.7?
=======================

This guide doesn't cover all changes in 0.7. See the full list of changes
in :ref:`changelog-0.7`.

Python 2 Removal
''''''''''''''''

Long overdue, but as Python 2 users slowly migrating to Python 3, Wand no
longer has a user base to support backwards compatibility with Python 2
language. All supporting Python 2 code in :mod:`wand.compat` has been
remove.


Evaluate Images
'''''''''''''''

Wand can now generate a new :class:`Image <wand.image.Image>` by evaluating
the source pixel-values read into an image stack.

For example::

    >>> from wand.color import Color
    >>> from wand.image import Image
    >>>
    >>> S=dict(width=1, height=1)
    >>> with Image() as src:
    ...     # Read 50% & 25% gray images.
    ...     src.read(pseudo='xc:gray50', **S)
    ...     src.read(pseudo='xc:gray25', **S)
    ...     # Create a new image by adding pixel values.
    ...     # ( 50% + 25% = 75% )
    ...     with src.evaluate_images(operator='add') as dst:
    ...         assert dst[0, 0] == Color('gray75')


Pyproject.toml
''''''''''''''

In an effort to modernize the codebase, Wand will start migrating from
:file:`setup.py` to :file:`pyproject.toml`.  The :file:`setup.py` file
will still be available for Wand 0.7.x releases.
